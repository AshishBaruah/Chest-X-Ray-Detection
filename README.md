# PNEUMONIA DETECTION USING CHEST X-RAY

Experience cutting-edge medical technology in action with our project, 'Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-ray Images.' Leveraging state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically the VGGNet model, we've developed a robust system capable of accurately identifying pneumonia in DICOM images (X-RAY).

Our user-friendly website, crafted with ReactJS, Python, and JavaScript, alongside the powerful Django/Fastapi framework, offers a seamless experience for users. Simply upload your chest X-ray image, and our advanced model, operating in the backend, swiftly generates a prediction, providing valuable insights for medical professionals and patients alike. Stay ahead in healthcare with our innovative solution, revolutionizing pneumonia detection.
